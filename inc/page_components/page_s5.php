            <p class="text-center">
              Over the years, I've dealt with nearly every major platform/language/software. Lots of new technology emerging, and I've been working on picking up as much as I can. Really, as long as it's reasonably documented, there's nothing I can't become proficient in in a matter of days.
            </p>

                <h5>PHP</h5>

                <p>PHP is one of my favorite languages, despite all of its shortcomings and the disdain of some (mostly younger) developers. It's mature, stable, and for just about anything you want to do there's a function for it. Also, after so many years of constant use, I am very comfortable with PHP.</p>

                <h5>.Net</h5>

                <p>Microsoft's scripting environments, like all others, have their good and bad points. I prefer open source, but I've had a reasonable amount of experience with classic ASP, ASP.net, VB.net, C#.net, and the rest of Microsoft's bundle of proprietary software.</p>

                <h5>JSP</h5>

                <p>Java has never been a favorite of mine, but I'm competent in it. JSP is much the same. I've coded fairly complex flex apps into JSP pages, and combined with Flash/Flex, JSP can be pretty powerful (though you can use Flash/Flex with other server-side technologies, and I would).</p>

                <h5>CGI</h5>

                <p>I've coded several sites in the Common Gateway Interface. You just don't see that many anymore, though. While somewhat clunky, CGI let me code in Perl, another of my favorite languages. Of course, I would never code a new site using CGI, but I have no fear if I encounter a legacy CGI app.</p>

                <h5>Linux</h5>

                <p>Linux is my preferred server OS. Ubuntu is my current favorite flavor, but I've worked with numerous distributions over the years. I really only use the command line when absolutely necessary. Most command line stuff can be done more easily via GUI tools. Some coders kind of sneer at that, but I see the console like the hammer in the age of the nail gun - sometimes it's the only thing that will work, so you have to have it, but you're gonna be using the gun 99% of the time.</p>

                <h5>Windows</h5>

                <p>Windows is my OS of choice for my PCs, having come up before every kid in the lecture had to have a Macbook Pro. Back when Mac was 5% of the PC population. Back when gaming on a Mac was iffy, and only high-end graphics people developed on Macs. Different world these days, but I have yet to ascertain any compelling reason to prefer Macs..</p>

                <h5>HTML5</h5>

                <p>I've worked with HTML since the days of the &lt;blink&gt; tag, and HTML5 is pretty awesome. There are so many possibilities opening up with semantic tags, the canvas, local storage, service workers, and more, though I am impatient it's taking so long to completely eliminate the gaping security hole that is Flash.</p>

                <h5>CSS3</h5>

                <p>I've worked with CSS since the days of table based layouts. With CSS3, it's amazing to see actually responsive web pages, having come up through the days of fixed width and distasteful compromises (hacks) to accomplish what should have been simple things.</p>

                <h5>ECMAScript/Javascript/jQuery</h5>

                <p>I've been working with Javascript since the early days, and have extensive experience. Way back in 1999 I was coding heavily animated pages with JS, including flies that flew randomly around the screen, sometimes executing mathematical tricks like spirals, figure 8s, and other polar equation based figures. jQuery and jQuery UI are my preferred javascript libraries, to eliminate cross-browser issues and keep the UX consistent. With the event processing they've perfected, the UI widget factory, jQuery Mobile, and more, my users get a top-notch experience.</p>

                <h5>Apache</h5>

                <p>I started with Apache back in '99, and my host and I learned much together. For instance, I learned how easy it is to infinitely loop http redirects using an .htaccess file, and my host learned how to prevent dummies from crashing their servers with infinite redirects. Suffice it to say I've come a long way, and not all of my lessons have been learned from my horrible mistakes. Many have been from the horrible mistakes of others.</p>

                </div>

                <h5>Nginx</h5>

                <p>I've done considerable work with Nginx, and while I naturally prefer Apache, having worked with it for years and years, Nginx offers some considerable benefits, especially if you're expecting to need massive scaling. I've ssen talk of hybrid systems that use both, taking advantage of the benefits of both, and that looks quite interesting.</p>

                </div>

                <h5>IIS</h5>

                <p>IIS gets a lot of flak, being an MS product, but really, it's not a bad server. I've done considerable work with IIS, and it has some distinct benefits. I really appreciate some of the debugging and performance monitoring facilities it provides, and it offers some really good options as far as configuring sites and resources.</p>

                <h5>Node.js</h5>

                <p>I've worked with Node a good bit, and it has some impressive strengths. I'm not sure I'm ready to switch over, but for some applications, it's the only real option. For instance, I set up a headless browser using PhantomJS and Node to capture screenshots of web pages and serve back the generated images. NoMinPostcards.com uses this to generate the postcards for print production.</p>

                <h5>MySQL</h5>

                <p>MySQL has been my primary go to DB for years. It's really come a long way, and even for enterprise level applications, it's a viable choice. It's really my DB of choice, and I would need compelling reasons to choose otherwise.</p>

                <h5>SQL Server</h5>

                <p>SQL Server is an excellent DB, and if you're working on an MS platform and server, it's the obvious choice. It's a very mature and well-maintained DB, and offers significant advantages for enterprise applications.</p>

              </div><!-- col-lg-3 -->

              <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-3 col-xs-12 l-chart-wrap text-center">

                </div>

                <h5>Oracle</h5>

                <p>Oracle has quite a reputation for enterprise DB performance, but in my experience, it's not as fast as MySQL, and every interface I used with it was a little clunky. But, despite its problems, it's a powerful system.</p>

                </div>

                <h5>Postgres</h5>

                <p>Postgres is probably my least favorite DB engine. The available management tools are low-quality, and it always seems very slow. It gets the job done, but if you're going open source for your DB, MySQL is always a better option than Postgres.</p>

                <h5>Access</h5>

                <p>Access, while a bottom-end DB, is certainly sufficient to handle small to medium data handling needs, and, being an MS product, it has some really nice interface software. I used to use it's schema designer to graphically design and share images of DB schemas I was going to use in other DBs.</p>

                <h5>DB2</h5>

                <p>I've run into DB2 here and there, but it definitely seems to be the least preferred of the enterprise level DB systems. Much of the work I've done with DB2 has been migrating to Oracle or SQL Server.</p>

                <h5>MongoDB</h5>

                <p>Mongo confuses a lot of people, mainly because it's not a relational database, as many think when they see the "DB" on the end of the name. For scalable indexed data storage, it's great, but if you want to relate any data in it, you either have to store it all together in one document, or use a script to process the relations, which is ridiculously inefficient. I've had to work with Mongo being used as a relational DB, and it's a nightmare.</p>

                <h5>Cloud Computing</h5>

                <p>I've worked with several cloud computing providers, including Google Cloud, AWS, and Rackspace. All of the systems I've worked with have been very easy to handle, really just a matter of following instructions. Some configurations can require a bit of finesse, but overall, most providers have removed all the mystery from standing up and maintaining cloud instances.</p>

                <h5>JS Frameworks/Managers</h5>

                <p>I've dealt with several JS &#8220;helpers&#8221; but there's just so many one could never really use them all. Ecma6 has defined a module loading system, but the major browsers haven't fully implemented it yet, so RequireJS, SystemJS, jspm, CommonJS, npm, Bower, Volo, RingoJS, Component, Ember.js, curl.js, and the others haven't gone the route of Flash yet.</p>

                <h5>Ruby, Python, ColdFusion</h5>

                <p>My experience with these three has only been in reading about them, or reading code written for them, I haven't even done a Hello World script with these. Wait, with CF I've done a Hello World, but that's all. But I have no doubt I could get up to speed in days and have them mastered in weeks if need be.</p>

                <h5>CSS Preprocessors</h5>

                <p>I've never used any of the CSS preprocessors, such as LESS, Sass, Stylus, Swith CSS, CSS-Crush, Myth, Clay, DtCSS, CSS Preprocessor or Rework, but I'm aware of them and understand the concepts, benefits, and drawbacks involved. I've looked into them some, and have no concern about rapidly picking one or more up should the need arise.</p>

                <h5>Frameworks</h5>

                <p>I've dealt with numerous PHP frameworks, my favorit being Yii. Symfony2 is pretty god, as well, since they resolved a lot of the problems I had with 1. I've also used Codeigniter and Cake, and I've used portions of Zend, though I've not used the entire Zend package, since it's awfully bloated.</p>

                </div>

                <h5>Vendor APIs</h5>

                <p>I've worked with a multitude of vendor APIs, some of the most notable being Google Maps, Google Charts, Authorize.net, USPS, UPS, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. The key to a good API is thorough and up to date documentation. If it's well documented, there's nothing I can't do with them. With poor documentation, it becomes a guessing game. I still get the job done, but it take a lot more time.</p>

                <h5>Programming Languages</h5>

                <p>Programming in BASIC on my TI-85 is what got me interested in programming as a career. EKU used C++ as their language for CSC majors, so I have extensive experience with that. I also used a good bit of C, VB, Perl, Java, and ARM Assembly code while at Eastern.</p>
