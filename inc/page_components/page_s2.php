            <p>
              In my ideal work environment, employees are respected and valued, and there is an established culture of using teamwork to accomplish goals. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Of course, the primary goal of employment is compensation. Gotta pay the bills, right? No matter how good a job might be otherwise, if the compensation isn't enough, then it just won't work. With my degree of skills and experience level, excellent compensation should be a given (don't want me worrying about my bills when I'm managing an important product launch, or resolving a crisis, after all). A good compensation package is a mix of excellent salary, health/dental/optical benefits for myself and my son, continuing education support of some sort, and enough paid time off that I am assured to get enough time to rest and relax with my family that I won't find myself wondering just what the heck I'm working so hard for.
            </p>

            <p>
              But compensation isn't everything. It's also very important for me to be a valued and respected member of the team. My experience and knowledge provide me with a lot of insight and good ideas, and it's important to me that my input is valued and not ignored or dismissed out of hand. Similarly, it's quite important to me that my supervisors understand that my compensation is an investment, not an expense, and for the company to take an interest in my continued education is to both our benefit, not just mine.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to the above, it is also important to me that the team I am a part of are all focused and dedicated to accomplishing the mission at hand. It seems too often that people get sidetracked, and prioritize things that are irrelevant to achieving the goals at hand. Politics and personal ambitions should not be allowed to interfere with getting the job done as efficiently and successfully as possible.
