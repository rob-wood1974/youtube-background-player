                <p style="position:relative;">
                  There is one very simple, all-encompassing reason to hire me: <b>return on investment</b>.
                </p>
                <p>My productivity is well above average. I have consistently impressed clients/employers with my ability to organize and simplify complex tasks, and to accomplish those tasks with extraordinary efficiency and accuracy. I communicate well with my team, and in every shop I've ever been in, all the way back to EKU's computer labs, all of the other coders around me have always looked to me for guidance and correction. I pursue my missions with purpose and intensity, relentlessly pushing the boundaries of technology, equipment, and myself. <b>I don't just try to be an asset to my employers, I make myself indispensable.</b> One employer, quite a few years back, said: "I wish I could clone you."</p>

                  I studied Computer Science at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eku.edu">Eastern Kentucky University</a>, but of course formal education comprises just a fraction of my learning. While my education in computer science is a wonderful foundation, I have been adding to my programming skills continually, since before I even entered college. My skill set is always expanding as I pick up new technologies and techniques.

                  When I tested at a post secondary level in 7<sup>th</sup> grade, they gave me the Stanfordâ€“Binet Intelligence Scale and came up with 136, 2 standard deviations above the mean (2.4 &sigma; > &mu;). That puts me in the 98.7775566587<sup>th</sup> percentile, making me 1 in 82 when it comes to processing logic. <span style="font-style:italic;font-size:.9em;">(A friend of mine insists that disclosing one's I.Q. is boastful, no matter how relevant it may be to the subject at hand, insisting "they can figure it out," and "you're just telling them you're an asshole." I maintain that this is a relevant fact when selling my intellectual labor. Hopefully you agree with me, not him.</span>

                  Similar to the concept of "mechanical aptitude," I have a "technological aptitude." Me and computers just get along well together. I code in my free time for fun. This is what I do, and I'm damn good at it. I can sit down with a system and really get to know it quite quickly. I am also quite fast at finding and fixing bugs. Coding is a just a world I am very comfortable in, more comfortable than most.
